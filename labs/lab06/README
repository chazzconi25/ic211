Making new types of dots is made easy via my MovingDot design. The user has
the ability to use the cardinal directions and basic instructions for left,
right, and diagonal to allow dots to move in any direction in any way.
Using simple loops these methods can be paired with random objects and
modulous calculations to increase or decrase the number of steps a dot takes
before deciding on a new path randomly or not randomly.

The polymorphic methods I created used are named left(), right(), and
diagonal(). These methods are all used in all three dots but can be
specifically found in Green Dot on lines 33, 34, and 37.
